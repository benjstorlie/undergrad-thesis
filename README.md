# Decomposing the $d$-Cube into Simplices

This is my undergrad thesis I completed for my Bachelor's for Mathematics at Scripps College in 2013. My advisor was Vin de Silva from Pomona College. Included here is both the paper I submitted, and the poster I presented at Capstone Day.

I've also included the original Matlab scripts I made while researching, in addition to the LaTeX scripts for the paper and poster. The images folder includes diagrams I made with MS Word, several of which are used in the paper or poster itself.

## Note on Extraneous Files

Many of the files included are not directly relevant to understanding the project. I have not reviewed this work for many many years. I'm sure there are duplicates, with one being and improved version of the other, or code that didn't work, but I didn't want to delete it at the time. There are also images which were simply lines or text used to make other images.

I do plan on reviewing this archive and pare it down to just what is useful for understanding the project and how my work was going.

## Future Plans

I do continue to come back to this problem even now. After college, not having Matlab, I made Google Sheets work beyond its intended use, needing to find ways to work around its maximum size. Since learning JavaScript and Node.js, I was able to save large sets of data for re-use in JSON files.

Finding the solution for decomposing a 4D cube is now down to finding complete subgraphs with 24 nodes in a ${16 \choose 5}$ node graph. This is a "hard" problem for a computer to do, but there is so much symmetry to be able to use to cut it down to smaller problems.

If nothing else, it's a motivation for learning new coding techniques and ways to increase efficiency.
